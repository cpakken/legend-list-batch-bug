### Description:

The <For optimized> component exhibits inconsistent behavior when used with an observable array of objects, specifically after clearing the array using () => list$.set([]), NOTE: () => list$.set(observable([])) works

Initial State/Pushing: Initially, both the normal <For> and <For optimized> components render correctly, and both react correctly to pushes before any clear() operation.

Clearing the Array: Using list$.set([]) to clear the observable array causes subsequent pushes to the array to not consistently trigger a re-render in the <For optimized> component. The normal <For> component continues to function correctly.

Inconsistent Re-rendering: After clearing the array, pushing new items sometimes causes a re-render, but often requires multiple pushes (~ 7 times) before the <For optimized> component updates. This behavior is inconsistent and unreliable.

Clearing with Observable: If the array is cleared using list$.set(observable([])) instead of list$.set([]), both <For> and <For optimized> continue to work correctly after pushes.

Direct Value Setting Works: If the observable array contains primitive values directly (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) instead of objects (e.g., [{ val: 1 }, { val: 2 }, { val: 3 }]), the issue does not occur.


### Expected Behavior:

Both <For> and <For optimized> should consistently re-render correctly after clearing the array and pushing new items, regardless of whether the array contains primitive values or objects.
